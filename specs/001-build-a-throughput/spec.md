**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build a throughput aggregating cellular modem bonder for the purpose of transmitting live video to a receiver forwarder that will aggregate and livestream to platforms."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors (field operator, transmitter, receiver forwarder, streaming platforms), actions (start/stop stream, bond links, forward output), data (link metrics, session state), constraints (live latency, variable cellular bandwidth)
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a field operator using a live video encoder with multiple cellular modems, I want the system to bond all available links so my live video reaches the receiver forwarder reliably and gets restreamed to selected platforms without drops, despite variable cellular conditions.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. Given a transmitter with three active cellular modems and a configured receiver forwarder with one destination platform, when the operator starts a live stream at a target 8 Mbps contribution bitrate, then the system bonds the links and delivers a continuous stream to the destination with stable video and audio, adapting to link variability without interruption.
2. Given an ongoing stream and one cellular modem loses connectivity for up to 30 seconds, when the link degrades or drops, then the system maintains the stream by redistributing traffic across remaining links and resumes using the recovered link automatically, with no stream termination or significant viewer-impacting interruption.
3. Given multiple destination platforms configured on the receiver forwarder, when the operator adds an additional platform during a live session, then the receiver forwarder begins restreaming to the new destination without interrupting the contribution feed.
4. Given aggregated uplink capacity temporarily falls below the configured target bitrate, when sustained deficit occurs, then the system degrades gracefully according to policy (e.g., step-down bitrate) rather than dropping the stream, and visibly communicates the state to the operator.

### Edge Cases
- All links down simultaneously: The stream is marked as at-risk; the transmitter continuously attempts reconnection, and the operator is alerted after a configurable threshold. Once any link recovers, contribution resumes automatically.
- Highly asymmetric link latency/jitter: The system avoids viewer-noticeable artifacts by biasing towards stable links and minimizing reordering delay while preserving live latency targets.
- Per-link data cap reached: The system honors configured caps and adjusts distribution to avoid overage, alerting the operator when caps constrain available throughput. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: cap thresholds and overage policy]
- Receiver forwarder unreachable: The transmitter indicates connection issues and retries with backoff; once reachable, streaming resumes without operator intervention. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: acceptable retry windows]
- Destination platform ingest failure: The receiver forwarder reports destination-specific errors and continues serving other platforms; operator can retry or remove the failing destination without impacting the contribution feed.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- FR-001: The transmitter MUST bond two or more network links from independent cellular modems to provide a single logical uplink for live video contribution.
- FR-002: The system MUST dynamically allocate contribution traffic across links to maximize effective throughput while maintaining configured live-stream latency targets.
- FR-003: The system MUST tolerate individual link failure or degradation without causing stream termination, automatically redistributing traffic to remaining links.
- FR-004: The receiver forwarder MUST accept inbound contribution from the transmitter and forward a single continuous output stream to one or more configured live platforms.
- FR-005: Operators MUST be able to Start/Stop the stream, set target bitrate/latency, and manage destination platforms from an operator interface (transmitter and/or receiver forwarder as appropriate). [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: control surface location(s)]
- FR-006: The system MUST provide real-time telemetry and historical logs of per-link status (throughput, loss, latency, jitter) and overall aggregated bitrate and health.
- FR-007: The system MUST support per-link data usage caps and cost-aware routing preferences to avoid overage charges. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: policy details and thresholds]
- FR-008: The system MUST maintain stream continuity across IP address changes and NAT traversal events typical of cellular networks. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: permitted methods and constraints]
- FR-009: End-to-end live latency MUST remain within [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: target range in seconds] under normal cellular conditions; variance MUST be communicated when outside target.
- FR-010: The receiver forwarder MUST support streaming to multiple platforms concurrently, with the ability to add or remove destinations during an active session without interrupting the contribution feed.
- FR-011: When aggregated capacity falls below target bitrate, the system MUST degrade gracefully according to a defined policy and recover to higher quality when capacity returns. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: degradation policy and minimum acceptable quality]
- FR-012: The system MUST expose health/status and alerts (e.g., all links down, destination failure, data cap reached) to the operator in near real-time.
- FR-013: The system MUST record and surface reasons for interruptions, stalls, or destination errors for post-event analysis and support.
- FR-014: Access to configuration and control MUST be restricted to authorized users, and contribution/control paths MUST be protected against unauthorized access. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: authentication model and encryption requirements]
- FR-015: The system MUST automatically recover from receiver or network outages within [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: recovery time objective] without requiring manual intervention.
