1. Redundant help/version tests in CLI suite

crates/bench-cli/tests/cli_tests.rs repeats many similar --help and --version assertions that all exercise clapâ€™s auto-generated output. These checks rarely break and substantially slow the suite.
Suggested taskTrim repetitive help/version tests in bench-cli
2. Heavy network tests run by default

Tests like test_cli_up_with_timeout spawn real network processes and may hang or require privileges, yet they run unconditionally.
Suggested taskGate network-dependent CLI tests
3. Duplicate GStreamer tests across crates

ristsmart/tests/element_pad_semantics.rs and crates/rist-elements/tests/element_pad_semantics.rs contain nearly identical code, doubling maintenance cost.
Suggested taskDeduplicate element_pad_semantics tests
4. Integration-tests crate lacks automated tests

crates/integration_tests exposes a library and an examples/end_to_end_test.rs executable but no #[test] entry points, so nothing runs under cargo test.
Suggested taskConvert integration example into automated test
5. Placeholder functions in netlink-sim are untested

netlink-sim/src/enhanced.rs exposes placeholder methods like start_race_car_bonding returning empty results without validation.
Suggested taskAdd unit tests for EnhancedNetworkOrchestrator
6. Minimal coverage for scenario definitions

crates/scenarios/src/lib.rs is a large module with only a few unit tests near the end, leaving many preset builders and utilities unverified.
Suggested taskExpand tests for scenario presets and utils
7. CLI command logic untested at unit level

Command implementations (cmd_up, cmd_run, etc.) in crates/bench-cli/src/main.rs are only exercised through integration tests, making failures harder to isolate.
Suggested taskIsolate and unit-test CLI command functions
8. Monolithic scenarios module hampers maintainability

crates/scenarios/src/lib.rs exceeds 1,000 lines and mixes data models, builders, presets, and tests in one file.
Suggested taskRefactor scenarios crate into modules
9. Large single test file for CLI

All CLI tests reside in one 250+ line file, making navigation and parallel execution difficult.
Suggested taskOrganize CLI tests by command
10. Manual println-based logging in integration tests

Integration helpers rely heavily on println! instead of the project-wide tracing macros, leading to inconsistent diagnostics.
Suggested taskAdopt tracing in integration test utilities
Summary

    Unnecessary tests: Redundant CLI help/version checks, duplicated GStreamer tests, and heavy network tests running unconditionally.

    Missing coverage: netlink-sim orchestrator, scenario presets, and extracted CLI command logic lack unit tests.

    Organization issues: Monolithic scenarios module, single-file CLI tests, and example-driven integration tests reduce maintainability.
