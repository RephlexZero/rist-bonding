Test Coverage Report
Areas with Unnecessary or Duplicative Testing
1. Duplicate Algorithm and Scenario Tests

ristsmart/tests and crates/rist-elements/tests contain nearly identical files (unit_swrr_algorithm.rs, recovery_scenarios.rs, ewma_algorithm.rs, etc.), causing the same logic to be exercised twice without adding coverage.
Suggested taskConsolidate algorithm tests for SWRR, EWMA, recovery scenarios, etc.
2. Overlapping Integration Tests

Integration tests appear in multiple locations:

    ristsmart/tests/integration_tests.rs

    crates/rist-elements/tests/integration_tests.rs

    The standalone crates/integration_tests crate (with an additional example at crates/integration_tests/examples/end_to_end_test.rs)

This fragmentation leads to slow CI and redundant scenarios.
Suggested taskUnify integration tests into a single suite
3. Scenario Validation Duplication

crates/netns-testbench/tests/integration.rs re-validates scenarios::Presets and builder functions already covered by crates/scenarios/src/lib.rs tests.
Suggested taskTrim redundant scenario validation tests
4. Low-value Tests in Integration Test Crate

crates/integration_tests/src/lib.rs only checks object construction and default values, offering little systemic validation.
Suggested taskReplace trivial tests with meaningful integration checks
Areas Requiring More Thorough Testing
5. Observability Crate Lacks Tests

The crates/observability module exposes metrics collection and trace recording but has no tests.
Suggested taskIntroduce unit tests for MetricsCollector and TraceRecorder
6. Bench CLI Without Validation

crates/bench-cli provides a command-line interface yet has no integration or unit tests.
Suggested taskAdd CLI integration tests using assert_cmd
7. Minimal Coverage for Enhanced Orchestrator

netlink-sim/src/enhanced.rs only tests basic constructor paths under the enhanced feature.
Suggested taskExpand EnhancedNetworkOrchestrator testing
8. Missing Error-Path Tests in Netns Testbench

While crates/netns-testbench/src/runtime.rs covers scheduling algorithms, it lacks tests for invalid configurations and concurrent runtime behavior.
Suggested taskCover error handling and concurrency in runtime scheduler
9. Under-tested GStreamer Integration

No tests cover the GStreamer-specific elements under ristsmart/crates/rist-elements pipelines.
Suggested taskCreate GStreamer element tests
These actions will remove redundant coverage and focus effort on untested but critical components, streamlining the test suite while increasing confidence in the codebase.
